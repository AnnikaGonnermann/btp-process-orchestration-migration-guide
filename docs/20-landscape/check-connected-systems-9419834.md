# Check Connected Systems

One of the first steps in your migration journey is to evaluate is which systems are currently connected to SAP Process Orchestration.

The following parameters are relevant for a high-level evaluation:

-   Cloud / On-Premise System

-   System Description

-   Direction

-   Adapter types \(protocols\)

-   Polling/Pushing


This information can be picked up from the SAP Process Orchestration System Landscape Directory through analysis of the Integration Directory \(ID\). With regards to the landscape, the migration to support Cloud systems should always be given except if the connected system has some specific requirements. For ground \(on-premise\) systems, additional checks are required as discussed in the following chapters.
