# Test Automation

As part of the testing phase in every migration project, you can find several products on the market that enable you to create automatic testing scenarios. This reduces risks to critical business processes and lowers the human effort to cover the test tasks of part or most of the interfaces.

Some of these tools support different SAP Products \(e.g. SAP Process Orchestration, Cloud Integration\) and can be used not only in the project but also in the future developments and maintenance. Note that itâ€™s important to verify the pricing conditions for each product.

There are some additional tools available from our partner ecosystem. For more information, visit the [SAP Store](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/search/Integration%20testing).
